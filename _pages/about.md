Welcome to my webpage!

I am a PhD candidate in econometrics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF) and Barcelona School of Economics (BSE), under the supervision of [Prof. Christian Brownlees](https://ctbrownlees.github.io/).

My research interests include high-dimensional econometrics, factor models, and empirical finance.
