I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. My thesis advisors are prof. Christian Brownlees and prof. Andrea Caggese. I am on the 2025-2026 Econ Job Market. My research lies at the intersection of econometrics and macroeconomics. I work on developing and applying causal econometrics tools to macroeconomics. I specialize in quantile regressions, local projections, and difference-in-differences. I study a broad range of macroeconomic topics from growth-at-risk to firm dynamics.
